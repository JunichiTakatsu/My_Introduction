# Junichi Takatsu
## Welcome to this page.
* This webpage is to introduce myself.
## I'm PhD with Engineering
* I'm graduated the department of Material Science and Engineering at Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.
* During my student life, I obtianed several skills to make my research life easier;
### Programming skills
To gather and analyze a plenty amount of data to find out novel interesting fact, I used my own custom made programs. Those programs were initially crafted using VBA on Microsoft Excel. This, however, was turned out to be too powerless to gather more data generated, I switched to Microsoft Visual Basic, which is similar but much faster to communicate with lab equipments. These devices had manuals which came with programming examples for their controls via RS-232 and GPIB. Using this, my first device automation was accomplished. I was able to control devices to perform experiments, which were required max 72 hours of human attention befor my program, and gather data into any format I can easily handle. I still can't believe I was the only one tried this in my lab at that time.

### Analitycal skills
This was my main task after gathering tons of data. This was like to think about the reason after finding out slight change brought from giving a small change to samples observing. In most of cases for me, my head was packed up with many possibilities to explain findings. If my knowledge was not enough to understand, I first checked papers related if I can find similar behavior observed in other materials. Once this process finished, I brought my ideas and explains to other researchers for discussion.

### Communication skills
To discuss about novel findings, I needed to talk with researchers from variety of areas with various perspectives. Due to the nature of different expertises, many common-senses for them were not in my knowledge. To understand their points, I had to train myself and managed making myself not to hesitate asking anything. I understand some might get disappointed asking their common sense, but it is clearly better to show how I understand to make deeper communications.

### Generalist skills
It might be special for Japan. I had to deal with many tasks not even related to researches, studies, and learning at my school. Every week, I had to manage under-garaduate students and score them as a teaching asistant, which was a role forced, unfortunatelly. No choise, but I had to gain a lot of skills to do anything possible to make any tasks given, including sometime making report, other time consult and encourage students, and another time refusing people tring to use for free. These experience granted me an avility to adopt myself various situations and roles, which is necessary to be a generalist. (or, possibly just a handy-man)

### Survival skills
As many PhD candidate students, I was also not financially stable at all. This definitelly make my stomach stronger and gifted sharp me eyes against cheap foods in grocery stores. Also, that situation granted me an ability to fix anything, such as broken cars, non-functioning heaters, ets.

## I worked as an AI/Robot/IoT Full-stack Engineer
* I was working at Chinougijustu co. ltd.,  located in Osaka, Japan.
* Started working as an Intern and part-time before being full-time worker.
* During this period, I experienced following;
### Enhancing programming skills
To apply AIs with neural networks into actual work scenes, I started using Python and PyTorch. These tools allowed me to experience the possibility of those AIs and difficulties. It is weird to say this, but it was like teaching things to babies who are the models made from scratch by myself. After these challenging situations, I have learned to use models which were slightly customized from the ones already available, such like Resnet, VGG, etc. 

### Negotiation skills
As a business, I had to deal with customers. Starting from hearing and consulting them, I made a rough skematic of their needs with avilable technologies to show. With this, I started convincing them how this would make their business more easy and cost effective. Sometimes, I even made small demo for them to make a contract come true.
